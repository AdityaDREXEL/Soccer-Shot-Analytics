🧠 Features & Code Structure
1. Scraping SofaScore API
Uses the requests library to fetch shot data for selected matches.

Extracts:

Player name

Shot type

Match situation

Coordinates

xG (expected goals)

xGOT (expected goals on target)

2. Creating DataFrames
Uses pandas to create a clean DataFrame of all relevant shot data.

Each match’s shots are neatly structured for further analysis.

3. Visualizing Shot Data
mplsoccer is used to draw a pitch and overlay shots.

Different shot outcomes (goals, misses, saves, etc.) are color-coded.

You can input a player’s name to isolate and visualize their shots.

🖼️ Example: Overall Goals Plot

📊 Example: Shots per Player (Bar Chart)

⚽ Example: All Shots by Ollie Watkins

4. Additional Analysis
Calculates average xG and xGOT values.

Ranks players based on shot quality and outputs leaderboard-style charts.

⚙️ Customization
This script is modular—feel free to:

Change match numbers to track different games.

Extend the scraping logic to include assists or heatmaps.

Modify chart colors or pitch settings using mplsoccer.
